# Smart-Water-Level-and-Rain-Detector
Smart water level and rain detector is a prototype that uses esp32 as a microcontroller as well as a raindrop sensor and ultrasonic sensor that functions to detect changes which then the data received by the sensor will be sent to the firebase database in realtime.

required components :
1. ESP32 devkit doit
2. raindrop sensor
3. potensiometer module for raindrop sensor
4. HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
5. buzzer
6. jumper cable
7. breadboard
